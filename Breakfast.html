            <p>Ingredients: For Pancake</p>
            <li>2cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2eggs</li>
            <li>
              2tablespoons melted and cooled butter (optional), plus unmelted
              butter for cooking, or use neutral oil
            </li>
            <li>1tablespoon sugar, optional</li>
            <li>1Â½ to 2 cups of milk</li>
            <br />
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof
              platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small
              bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set
              aside<br />
              In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg.
              Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened
              (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine)<br />
              Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over
              medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil;
              carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.<br />
              For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet,
              using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you
              should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).<br />
              Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have
              burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and
              cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer
              to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil,
              and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining
              batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired
              toppings.

          <ul>
            <p>Ingredients: For Dosa</p>
            <li>Dosa batter(Batter should be little thin)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup regular rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole urad dal(Without skin)</li>
            <li>1/4 tea spoon fenugrwek seeds </li>
            <li>1/2 table spoon chana dal</li>
            <li>water as needed</li>
            <br />
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <li>
              Heat a pan/Tawa. It should be very hot.
Add 2-3 drops of oil on the pan, and rub the oil with the help of a Tissue paper or a cut potato or wet cloth.
Oil for Shallow frying
Add a spoonful of batter and spread it in circles in one direction. (Spread it as thin as required)
Dosa Batter
One needs to be quick as the dosa pan is hot and it will start cooking.
One can remove the pan from the stove.
Spread the dosa and then put the pan back on the stove.
This helps the batter not sticking and creating lumps, as well as a good method for beginners.
Drizzle some oil on the sides.
Many want to avoid the extra oil, but adding of the oil adds to the taste.
Turn and cook for a couple of seconds. (Cooking on the other side is optional).
Repeat above steps for making the remaining dosa
Hot and crispy Dosa are ready. Serve with Chutney or Sambar.
